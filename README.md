## Customization

### Adding New Account Map Lanes

Edit the `LANE_CONFIG` in `/app/api/prospect/route.ts`:

```typescript
const LANE_CONFIG = {
  // Add new lanes here
  "Sales": { 
    departments: ["sales"], 
    titles: ["CRO", "VP Sales", "Head of Sales"] 
  }
};
```

### Modifying Solution Alignment

Update the OpenAI prompt in `/app/api/prospect/route.ts` to include your specific solutions and use cases.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"APOLLO_API_KEY environment variable is required"**
   - Ensure your `.env.local` file has the correct API key
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **"OpenAI API error"**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
   - Check if you're hitting rate limits

3. **No contacts found**
   - Apollo.io data varies by company
   - Try using the company's exact domain name
   - Some companies may have limited public contact data
